# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship - Task 05

## Overview
This repository contains the work completed for Task 05 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science internship. The objective of this task was to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Additionally, visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors were created.

## Task Description
### Task 05: Analyze Traffic Accident Data
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Prepared the dataset for analysis.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Explored patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
   - Identified factors contributing to accidents.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created various plots to visualize accident hotspots and other contributing factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Road Traffic Accidents dataset, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/road-traffic-accidents).
